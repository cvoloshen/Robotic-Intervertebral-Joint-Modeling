# Robotic-Intervertebral-Joint-Modeling
Included in this repository are several movement scripts, which models physiological movement in the C3-C4 vertebral section using a robotic arm. Included in the code are separate functions that simulate flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation under compression via PID force control.
