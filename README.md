# Robotic-Intervertebral-Joint-Modeling
Included in this repository are several movement scripts for a robotic arm, all of which are meant to model physiological movement in the C3-C4 spinal section for verification of an intervertebral cage. Included in the code are separate functions that simulate flexion, extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation under compression via PID force control.
